# RL1_Navigation
Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program project 1 

The simulation contains a single agent that navigates a large environment. At each time step, it has four actions at its disposal:
0 - walk forward
1 - walk backward
2 - turn left
3 - turn right
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction. A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.
